\chapter{Introduction and problem statement}
\label{cha:intro}
With the enormous amount of data we produce nowadays, data mining is becoming more and more prevalent.
Consequently, the goal with modern data mining methods is not only to discover information from crude data, but also to condense that information down to concise descriptions and insights.
One such method is redescription mining~\citep{ramakrishnan_turning_2004}.
In a nutshell, it aims to find different ways to describe the same things.

\chapter{Background Knowledge}
\label{cha:background}
In this chapter we are going to explore the underlying theory of the thesis.
We will go from more general knowledge to more specific concepts.
Firstly, the data mining concepts and framework are introduced.
Data mining is the process of extracting information from raw data.
Then we will dig deeper into frequent itemset mining and redescription mining, which are the two main tasks that the thesis is built upon.
